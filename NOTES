I think the standard libraries are compiled using PSYQ-3.5 but the game code
itself is compiled using gcc 2.8.1 from PSYQ-4.3


Memory map of data sections:

80047d04    libspu vars
80047d44    main.c vars
80047d74    274C.c vars
80047e6c    main.c vars (but could belong to 274C too maybe)

uninitialized
80048000    274C.c vars
80048044    main.c vars
(big buffers in this part for 274C.c)
80052248    libgpu data
...         other standard lib data




JM1/MAIN.PEX

It seems to have libgpu linked into it again. Since it's very likely that it's the same
version of the library as the one in main, it should be possible to find duplicates.
It still uses the LoadImage and DrawSync functions that are provided in the jmptable,
so I don't know what exactly is going on there. There is a good chunk of libgpu included
in it tho.

In addition to that it has something we haven't dealt with yet: libgte. This file actually
is going to be doing 3D rendering so things are about to get interesting.
The file map doesn't seem to be as tidy and organized as main. Gonna have to figure it out.
